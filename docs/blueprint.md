# **App Name**: LinguaLibre

## Core Features:

- Dictionary Loading: Automatically load dictionary data from a `words` file located in the `/dictionary/` folder at the root of the project. Choose an appropriate file format.
- Data Parsing: Parse data into key-value pairs, using keys like 'name', 'translated name', and 'description'.
- Entry Display: Display each entry (name, translated name, description) in a distinct, visually appealing box.
- Search and Filter: Enable users to quickly find entries using a search bar, filtering by name, translated name, or description.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: White (#FFFFFF) for a clean and simple look.
- Box color: Light green (#D0F0C0) for each entry, providing a gentle contrast.
- Accent color: Slightly darker green (#A8D8A2) to highlight active elements or interactive components.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern and readable sans-serif for both headings and body text.
- Each dictionary entry will be displayed within a distinct box, arranged in a clear, readable layout. Use sufficient spacing to avoid a cluttered look.
